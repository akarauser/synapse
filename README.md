Summarization Model

This script trains a summarization model using the Transformers library and a custom dataset. It loads the training and evaluation datasets, tokenizes the data, trains the model, and saves the trained model for later use. The code employs a logging system for debugging and monitoring, ensuring robust operation. The model leverages pre-trained sequence-to-sequence architecture for efficient summarization.
